# Azure DevOps Repos

**Azure Repos is a set of version control tools that you can use to manage your code, just like GitHub**. Whether your software project is large or small, using version control as soon as possible is a good idea.

Version control systems are software that help you track changes you make in your code over time. As you edit your code, you tell the version control system to take a snapshot of your files. The version control system saves that snapshot permanently, so you can recall it later if you need it. Use version control to save your work and coordinate code changes across your team.

Even if you are working on a personal project, version control helps you stay organized as you fix bugs and develop new features. Version control keeps your development history so you can quickly review and even roll back to any code version.

- Helps you track changes in the codebase
- Maintains the history of your codebase, who made the changes, what changes were made, why the changes were made, etc
- Helps you stay organized
- Gives you the ability to rollback the changes as needed


## Git vs. TFVC

Azure Repos supports two types of Version Control:
- Git
- TFVC ( Team Foundation Version Control)
